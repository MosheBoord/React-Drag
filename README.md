# React-Drag
A Library for Drag and Drop interactions in react.

Run npm i @darthbane/react-drag to install.

There are four things you can import from this library: 1) Draggable 2) Dragsurface 3) ReactDragManager 4) getDefaultManager.

Draggable:

This is a react component that makes a draggable component out of all it's children.
If you wish to make it interactive, you will need to add an item prop. The item prop is an object that must contain a className key and may contain a data key.
